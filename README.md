## INTRODUCTION:

*    Computer networks allow multiple devices to communicate and share information efficiently. In this experiment, three different LAN networks (192.168.10.0/24, 192.168.20.0/24, and 192.168.30.0/24) are interconnected using routers, switches, and PCs.
The purpose of this practical task is to configure the PCs, switches, and routers so that devices across different networks can communicate with each other using proper IP addressing and routing.

*  This experiment also verifies whether the configured network supports successful end-to-end connectivity using the ping command.

## DESCRIPTION:
The network contains three LANs, each connected to a router:

| LAN      | Network Address | Default Gateway | PCs                    |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **LAN1** | 192.168.10.0/24 | 192.168.10.1    | PC0 – 10.2, PC1 – 10.3 |
| **LAN2** | 192.168.20.0/24 | 192.168.20.1    | PC2 – 20.2, PC3 – 20.3 |
| **LAN3** | 192.168.30.0/24 | 192.168.30.1    | PC4 – 30.2, PC5 – 30.3 |


Routers are also interconnected using Serial interfaces forming:

* 10.0.0.0/30 (Router0 ↔ Router1)

* 11.0.0.0/30 (Router1 ↔ Router2)

The main goal is to configure:

* 1.Router interfaces with proper IPs

* 2.Static routes so all routers know each other's networks

* 3.PC configurations using correct IP, subnet mask, and gateway

* 4.Testing connectivity using ping

## PROCEDURE:
# Step 1 — Configure PC IP Addresses:

* PC0 (LAN1)
IP Address: 192.168.10.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1

* PC1 (LAN1)
IP Address: 192.168.10.3
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1

* PC2 (LAN2)
IP Address: 192.168.20.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1

* PC3 (LAN2)
IP Address: 192.168.20.3
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1

* PC4 (LAN3)
IP Address: 192.168.30.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.30.1

* PC5 (LAN3)
IP Address: 192.168.30.3
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.30.1

# Step 2 — Configure Router Interfaces:
* Router0
```
int fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shut
!
int s2/0
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
 clock rate 64000
 no shut
```

* Router1
```
int fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
 no shut
!
int s2/0
 ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
 no shut
!
int s3/0
 ip address 11.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
 no shut
```
* Router2
```
int fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
 no shut
!
int s2/0
 ip address 11.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
 clock rate 64000
 no shut
```
# Step 3 — Configure Static Routing
* Router0
```
ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
```
* Router1
``
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 11.0.0.2
```
* Router2
```
ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 11.0.0.1
ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 11.0.0.1
```
```
# Step 4 — Verify Using PING:

* From PC0 → PC3

C:\> ping 192.168.20.3
Reply from 192.168.20.3: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128


* From PC4 → PC1

C:\> ping 192.168.10.3
Reply from 192.168.10.3: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128


All PCs across three LANs should successfully communicate.

## OUTPUR:

* All PC IP-confrations:

* All  successful ping connections:

## RESULT:

* The network was successfully configured with three LAN segments connected through routers using static routing. All PCs received valid IPv4 addresses, and routing ensured cross-network communication.

* The ping results confirmed successful connectivity between all devices in LAN1, LAN2, and LAN3. This shows that the IP addressing, router configuration, and static routing were implemented correctly.
